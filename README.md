# Keylogger using pynput

This is a simple keylogger script written in Python using the `pynput` library. It records the keys pressed by the user and stores them in a file named `key.txt`.

## Uses

- Educational purposes: You can use this keylogger script to learn about keyboard input monitoring and basic file handling in Python.

- Personal use: Use it to keep track of your own typing habits or to log keyboard shortcuts for various applications.

- Debugging: The keylogger can be used to identify keyboard input issues in your applications.

## How to Use

1. Install the required `pynput` library by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install pynput
   
## 1 Run the script using Python:
python keylogger.py

## 2 The keylogger will start recording keystrokes and save them in the key.txt file. Press the Esc key to stop the keylogger.

## Upgrade

Future upgrades and improvements for the keylogger script may include:

Enhanced log format: Improving the formatting of the logged keystrokes to include timestamps or differentiate between different key events.

Remote monitoring: Adding functionality to send the logged data to a remote server for monitoring.

Encryption: Implementing data encryption to ensure secure storage of the logged information.

User settings: Adding configuration options to customize the behavior of the keylogger.
